# HTML and CSS Course Website Repository

## Description

This repository contains three projects from a HTML and CSS Course in which I enrolled.

These projects consist of simple websites, developed with HTML and CSS, and served as an introduction to several topics of interest in Website Development, such as:

-   Responsive Layouts
-   Media Queries
-   CSS Animations
-   FlexBox and CSS Grid
-   Sass Language
-   HTML5 Semantics
-   etc.

## Course

The course in question is **"The Creative HTML5 & CSS3 Course"**, from Dev Ed, a well known multimedia content creator with over 200k subscribers on YouTube.

The course is very well done and provides a great selection of resources that can get anyone started with HTML and CSS, the fundamental technologies of Website Development.
